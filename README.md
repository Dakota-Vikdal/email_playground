# email_playground
In this project I've created a dummy gmail account that I used in order to send emails via a Python script. 

I started with importing all the required libraries. 

I then created an html file that holds a very basic html format with some text in the body. 

Next I established various email details such as who the email is from, who it's going to and what the subject is. 

The dynamic aspect of the html document was then utilized via a dictionary.

Lastly, I used a with statement in order to grab the email I wished to send from.

The rest is history. I walk away with a new tool to play with and implement in future projects. Thanks for reading.
